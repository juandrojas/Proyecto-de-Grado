\section{Linear topologies}
Fix a ground field $k$. From now on, a vector space will always mean a $k$-vector space.
\begin{definition}\label{def:linear_topology}
A \textbf{linear topology} on a vector space $V$ is a separated (Hausdorff) topology invariant under translations that admits an open local base around zero of vector subspaces. A vector space equipped with a linear topology will be referred as \textbf{linearly topologized}.
\end{definition}
If we endow $k$ with the discrete topology then $V$ will become a topological vector space. From now on, endow $k$ with the discrete topology. \\
Linear topologies behave nicely under basic topological operations.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:linear_topologies_properties}
Let $V$ be a linearly topologized vector space. Then
	\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
		\item Any vector subspace of $V$ is linearly topologized under its subspace topology.
		\item If $W \subseteq V$ is a closed vector subspace then $V/W$ is linearly topologized under its quotient topology.
		\item If $\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha}$ is a collection of linearly topologized vector spaces its product $\prod_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$ and its direct sum $\bigoplus_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$ is linearly topologized under its product topology.
		\item If $W$ is a vector subspace of $V$, then its topological closure $\overline{W}$ also is a vector subspace of $V$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Since intersection of vector subspaces is a vector subspace, (a) follows intersecting the fundamental system of neighborhoods in $V$ by the vector subspace. For (b), let $\pi\colon V \to V/W$ be the quotient map. Since $\pi$ is open and surjective the image of a local base is a local base; moreover, the image of a vector subspace under $\pi$ is a vector subspace. In addition, since $W$ is closed then $V/W$ is Hausdorff.  Now, for (c) let $\{U_{\alpha, \beta}\}_{\beta}$ be a local base of zero in $V_{\alpha}$ of vector subspaces, the products $U_{\alpha_{1}, \beta_{1}} \times \ldots \times U_{\alpha_{n}, \beta_{n}} \times \prod_{\gamma} V_{\gamma}$, where $\gamma$ ranges over $\alpha \neq \alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}$, for any set $\{(\alpha_{1}, \beta_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}, \beta_{n})\}$ form a fundamental system of neighborhoods around zero in $\prod_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$ of open vector subspaces. Note that since $\bigoplus_{\alpha} V_{\alpha} \subseteq \prod_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$ is a vector subspace (c) follows from (a). Finally, for (d), suppose $x,y\in \overline{W}$, then, for every open vector subspace $U$, $(x + U)\cap W \neq \emptyset$ and $(y + U)\cap W \neq \emptyset$, therefore for every $\alpha, \beta \in k$ we have $(\alpha x + U)\cap W \neq \emptyset$ and $(\beta y + U)\cap W \neq \emptyset$. Hence, $(\alpha x + \beta y + U)\cap W\neq \emptyset$ for every open vector subspace $U$ and every pair $\alpha, \beta\in k$. It follows (d).
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:limits-and-colimits-in-lintop-category}
	Using an argument similar to the previous proposition one can check that in the category $\mathsf{LinTop}_k$ of linearly topologized vector spaces limits and colimits indexed by small categories exist.
\end{remark}
Linear topologies are discrete over a finite dimensional vector space.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:finite_dimensional_linear_topologies}
A finite dimensional linearly topologized vector space $V$ is discrete.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $U$ be an open vector subspace and $0 \neq x \in U$, since $V$ is separated there exists an open vector subspace $U_{x}$ such that $x \not\in U_{x}$. Thus, $\dim U_{x} \cap U < \dim U$. Since $V$ is finite dimensional this process can be repeated only a finite amount of times; that is $\{0\}$ is open. It follows that $V$ is discrete.
\end{proof}
\subsection*{Commensurability}
We introduce a partial order in the set of vector subspaces of a vector space $V$.
\begin{definition}\label{def:commensurability}
	For vector subspaces $A$ and $B$ of a vector space $V$ we say that $A \prec B$ if the quotient $A/(A\cap B) \cong (A+B)/B$ is finite dimensional (or equivalently $A \subseteq B + W$ for some finite dimensional $W$). In addition, we say that $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{commensurable} (denoted $A \sim B$) if $A \prec B$ and $B \prec A$.
\end{definition}
Observe that $A \sim B$ if and only if $(A+B)/(A\cap B) \cong A/(A\cap B) \oplus B/(A \cap B)$ is finite dimensional. We will constantly refer to a vector space $V$ being finite dimensional as $V \sim 0$.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:equivalence-relation}
	Let $V$ be a vector spaces and $A,B$ and $C$ be vector subspaces, then:
	\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
		\item If $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$ then
		\[
			\frac{A+B+C}{A \cap B \cap C} \sim 0
		\]
		\item If $A \prec B$ and $B \prec C$ then $A \prec C$. Moreover, commensurability is an equivalence relation.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the following exact sequences
	\[
		0 \to \frac{A\cap B}{A \cap B \cap C} \to \frac{B}{B \cap C}, 
	\]
	and,
	\[
		0 \to \frac{A\cap B}{A \cap B \cap C} \to \frac{A+B}{A \cap B \cap C}
		\to \frac{A+B}{A \cap B} \to 0
	\]
	induced by inclusions. The first inclusion plus the fact that $B \sim C$ imply that $(A\cap B)/(A \cap B \cap C)$ is finite dimensional. Now, since $A \sim B$ it follows that $(A+B)/(A \cap B)$ is finite dimensional. Hence, the second exact sequence concludes that $(A+B)/(A \cap B \cap C)$. A symmetrical argument shows that $(B+C)/(A \cap B \cap C) \sim 0$. These prove (a). For (b), the inclusion
	\[
		0 \to \frac{A+C}{A\cap C} \to \frac{A+B+C}{A \cap B \cap C}
	\]
	plus (a) implies transitivity. 
\end{proof}
Now, we state and prove some useful properties on the relation $\prec$.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemm:properties-order-well-behaved-under-operations}
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item If $A \subseteq B$ then $A \prec B$.
	\item If $A \prec B$ then $f(A) \prec f(B)$ for any $k$-linear map $f$
	\item It holds that
	\[
		\sum_{i=1}^{m} A_{i} \prec \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} B_{j} \iff A_{i} \prec B_{j}\text{ for all } i \text{ and } j.
	\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	First, (a) is immediate from the definition of $\prec$. Second, for (b) the map $f$ factors as
	\[
		A/(A\cap B) \to f(A)/(f(A)\cap f(B)) \to 0
	\]
	Finally, for (c), if $\sum_{i=1}^{m} A_{i} \prec \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} B_{j}$ holds then by (a) above, for all $i$ and $j$ we have
	\[
		A_{i} \prec \sum_{i=1}^{m} A_{i} \prec \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} B_{j} \prec B_{j}
	\]
	On the other hand, if $A_{i} \prec B_{j}$ for all $i$ and $j$ then there exists finite dimensional subspaces $W_{ij}$ such that $A_{i} \subseteq B_{j} + W_{ij}$ for all $i$ and $j$. Therefore,
	\[
		\sum_{i=1}^{m} A_{i} \subseteq \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} B_{j} + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} W_{ij}.
	\]

\end{proof}
Next, we consider another useful lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemm:commensurability-addition-and-intersection}
	Let $A,B,A',B'$ be vector subspaces of a vector space $V$ and suppose that $A \sim A'$ and $B \sim B'$. Then $A + B \sim A' + B'$ and $A \cap B \sim A' \cap B'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The following exact sequence 
	\small
	\[
		0 \to \frac{A + A' + B + B'}{A\cap A'\cap B\cap B'} \to \frac{A + A'}{A \cap A'} \oplus \frac{B + B'}{B \cap B'} \to \frac{A + A' + B + B'}{(A\cap A') + (B\cap B')} \to 0
	\]
	\normalsize
	plus $A \sim A'$ and $B \sim B'$ imply that both spaces
	\[
		\frac{A + A' + B + B'}{A\cap A'\cap B\cap B'} \quad\text{and,}
		 \frac{A + A' + B + B'}{(A\cap A') + (B\cap B')}
	\]	
	are finite dimensional. Since, $(A + A' + B + B')/(A+A')\cap(B+B')$ is a quotient of the second space and $((A \cap A') + (B \cap B'))/((A\cap A')\cap(B\cap B'))$ is a subspace of the first space we can conclude $A + B \sim A' + B'$ and $A \cap B \sim A' \cap B'$.
\end{proof}
If we consider the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ on a vector space $V$ then $\prec$ is a partial order on it and by \cref{lemm:commensurability-addition-and-intersection} above it inherits operations $\cap$ and $+$.
\subsection*{Linear compactness}
\begin{definition}\label{def:linear_compactness}
	Let $V$ be a linearly topologized vector space. A closed subset $L \subseteq V$ is \textbf{linearly compact} (respectively \textbf{linearly cocompact}) if for every open vector subspace $U$ we have $L \prec U$ (respectively $V/(L+U) \sim 0$). 
\end{definition}
Linear compactness behaves just as compactness if one uses the correct words.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:linear_compactness_properties}
	Let $V$ be a linearly compact vector space, then
	\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
		\item If $A \subseteq V$ is a vector subspace such that for every open vector subspace $U$ of $V$ it holds $A \prec U$ then $\overline{A}$ is linearly compact.
		\item If $f\colon V \to W$ is a continuous linear homomorphism then $\overline{f(V)}$ is linearly compact.
		\item If $V$ is discrete then $V \sim 0$.
		\item Every closed vector subspace of $V$ is linearly compact.
		\item (Tychonov) If $\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha}$ is a collection of linearly compact vector spaces then its product $\prod_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$ and its direct sum $\bigoplus_{\alpha}V_{\alpha}$ are linearly compact.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $U$ be any open vector subspace of $V$, then $A + U$ is closed, that is $A + U = \overline{A + U} \supseteq \overline{A} + U \supseteq A + U$, thus, $\overline{A} + U = A + U$. Since, $(A + U)/U \sim 0$ then $(\overline{A} + U)/U \sim 0$. We get (a). 

	For (b), since $f$ is a continuous linear map $V \prec f^{-1}(U)$ for all $U$ open vector subspace of $W$, hence by \cref{lemm:properties-order-well-behaved-under-operations} $f(V) \prec U$ for all open vector subspaces $U$ of $W$. By the previous observation and (a) we get (b). If $V$ is discrete, then $\{0\}$ is an open vector subspace of $E$, thus $V \prec U$, we get (c). 

	For (d), if $A \subseteq V$ is a closed vector subspace, and $V \prec U$ for all open vector subspaces $U$ by \cref{lemm:properties-order-well-behaved-under-operations} we get $A \prec U$. 

	Finally, for (d), it is enough proving for open vector subspaces $U = \prod_{\beta} U_{\beta} \times \prod_{\gamma} V_{\gamma}$ where $\beta$ ranges over a finite set, $\gamma$ ranges over $\alpha \neq \beta$ and $U_{\beta}$ is an open vector subspace of $V_{\beta}$. Then, the quotient
	\[
		\prod_{\alpha}V_{\alpha} / U \cong \prod_{\beta} V_{\beta}/U_{\beta}
	\]
	where $\cong$ is a topological and algebraic isomorphism. Since $V_{\alpha}$ is linearly compact for all $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ranges over a finite set we conclude that $\prod_{\alpha} V_{\alpha} / U$ is finite dimensional; therefore, $\prod_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$ is linearly compact. The proof is analogous for $\bigoplus_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$.
\end{proof} 
\subsection*{Completion}
\begin{definition}\label{def:completion}
	If $V$ be a linearly topologized vector space, recall that $V$ is said to be \textbf{complete} if 
	\[
		V \cong \varprojlim_{U \in \operatorname{Op}(V)} V/U
	\]
	where $\text{Op}(V)$ runs through all open vector subspaces of $V$. In particular, this implies that for every base $\mathscr{U}$ of zero made from open vector subspaces of $V$ we have
	\[
		V \cong \varprojlim_{U \in \mathscr{U}} V/U
	\]
\end{definition}

\section{Tate spaces}
\subsection*{Lattices}
\begin{definition}\label{def:c-lattice}
	If $V$ is a linearly topologized vector space we say that a \textbf{c-lattice} is an open linearly compact subspace of $V$, \textit{dually} a discrete linearly cocompact subspace is a \textbf{d-lattice}.
\end{definition}
First, we prove that existence of a c-lattice in a linearly topologized vector space is equivalent to existence of a d-lattice.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:c-lattice-iff-d-lattice}
	A linearly topologized vector space $V$ has a c-lattice if and only if it has a d-lattice. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $L$ is a c-lattice in $V$, choose any direct complement $D$ of $L$, that is, $V = L \oplus D$. Since $L$ is open, then $D$ is discrete as $D\cap L = 0$, thus ${0}$ is open in $D$. Moreover, $D$ is closed as it is the fiber of $0$ under the projection $V \to L$ (which is continuous because $L$ is open). Finally, we check that $D$ is linearly cocompact: let $U$ be any open vector subspace of $V$, the composition $L \hookrightarrow V \twoheadrightarrow V/(D+U)$ induces a surjection 
	\[
		L/(L \cap U) \twoheadrightarrow V/(D+U)
	\]
	thus, since $\dim L / (L \cap U) < \infty$ we conclude $\dim V/(D+U) < \infty$. \\
	Now, suppose $D$ is a d-lattice. Thus, there exists an open vector subspace $U$ such that $U \cap D = 0$. This time, choose $L$ a direct complement for $D$ containing $U$. Then, the projection $$. Let $U$ be any open vector subspace, the composition $V \twoheadrightarrow L \twoheadrightarrow L/(L \cap U)$ induces a surjection
	 \[
	 	V/(D + (L \cap U)) \twoheadrightarrow L/(L \cap U)
	 \]
	 since both $L$ and $U$ are open, also $L\cap U$, thus $\dim V/(D + (L \cap U)) < \infty$. It follows, $\dim L/(L \cap U) < \infty$ and $L$ linearly compact.  
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\label{up-to-finite-dimension}
	Note that in the proof of \cref{prop:c-lattice-iff-d-lattice} it is not strictly necessary to choose a direct complement, one can choose a direct complement up to finite dimension; that is, $L + D \sim V$ and $L \cap D \sim 0$. 
\end{remark}
We now give a characterization of lattices in terms of $\prec$.
%\begin{proposition}\label{prop:maximality-lattices}
	%A linearly compact subspace is a c-lattice if and only if it is maximal among the set of linearly compact sets ordered by $\prec$. 
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
	%\textcolor{red}{this one needs some thinking}
%\end{proof}
%not necessary
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:lattices-are-basis}
	If $V$ admits a c-lattice, then the set of c-lattices constitutes a base of zero of mutually commensurable vector subspaces.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	If $L$ and $L'$ are two c-lattices in $V$ then $L \prec L'$ and $L' \prec L$ because both are open; therefore, all c-lattices are commensurable. Moreover, if $U$ is any open vector subspace and $L$ is a c-lattice we claim that $L \cap U$ is a c-lattice. Indeed, let $U'$ be any open vector subspace, then $L\cap U \prec L\prec U'$. In addition, since $L$ and $U$ are open, $L \cap U$ is open. Thus $L \cap U \subseteq U$ is a c-lattice, this proves the statement.
\end{proof}
We're now ready to introduce the definition of a Tate space.
\begin{definition}\label{def:tate-vector-space}
	A \textbf{Tate space} $V$ is a complete linearly topologized vector space that admits a c-lattice. By the previous proposition and the observation in \cref{def:completion} we get
	\[
		V \cong \varprojlim_{L \in \mathscr{L}(V)} V/L
	\]
	where $\mathscr{L}(V)$ runs through all c-lattices of $V$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}\label{ex:tate-spaces}
We give some examples of Tate spaces.
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Any vector space endowed with the discrete topology is a Tate space.
	\item If $\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha}$ is any pro-system of finite dimensional vector spaces (thus, each one endowed with the discrete topology by \cref{prop:finite_dimensional_linear_topologies}), let $V$ be their inverse limit endowed with the inverse limit topology. We claim that this is a linearly compact space. Indeed, if we realize $V$ as a subspace of the product $\prod_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$, then basic open vector subspaces are just restriction of finite coordinates. Hence, the quotient of $V$ by any basic open vector subspace is a finite product of $V_{\alpha}$, since all $V_{\alpha}$ are finite dimensional we conclude that $V$ is linearly compact and therefore a Tate space.
	\item Let $V = k\left((t)\right)$ with the topology generated by letting $t^{n}k\left[[t]\right]$ for $n \in \Z$ be a system of neighborhoods of zero. Then, $V = k\left[[t]\right] \oplus t k[t^{-1}]$ where $k\left[[t]\right]$ is the completion of $k[x]$ in the $\left\langle x\right\rangle$-adic topology, hence by the previous item linearly compact and, since it is open is a c-lattice. By the argument given in \cref{prop:c-lattice-iff-d-lattice} $t k[t^{-1}]$ is a d-lattice. Therefore, $V$ is a Tate space that is not linearly compact nor discrete.
	
	\end{enumerate}

\end{example}
\subsection*{Duality}
If $V$ is a Tate space we consider the following topology on the dual space $V^{*}$ (where by dual space we mean topological dual). Open vector subspaces are given by
\[
	L^{\perp} = \{\phi\in E^{*} \colon \phi\lvert_{L} = 0\}
\]
where $L$ is a linearly compact subspace. Equivalently, one can define open vector subspaces in $E^{*}$ to be $D^{*}$ where $D$ a direct complement of a linearly compact vector subspace $L$ in $E$ (in this case $D^{*} \hookrightarrow E^{*}$ using the decomposition $L\oplus D$).  \\
First, we prove that the word \emph{dually} in \cref{def:linear_compactness} actually makes sense. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lemm:duality-d-lattice-c-lattice}
	Duality interchanges linearly compact with discrete spaces and vice-versa. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	If $L$ is a linearly compact vector space, then $L^{\perp}$ is open in $L^{*}$, thus $L^{*}$ is discrete. If $D$ is discrete, then $D \cong k^{\oplus \Lambda}$ for some $\Lambda$ and endowing $k^{\oplus \Lambda}$ with the discrete topology the previous isomorphism is a homeomorphism too. Moreover, since $D$ is discrete every linear functional is continuous. Using \cref{rem:limits-and-colimits-in-lintop-category} and the well known identity (where maps are isomorphisms in $\mathsf{LinTop}_{k}$)
	\[
		(k^{\oplus \Lambda})^{*} = \Hom_{k}(k^{\oplus \Lambda}, k) \cong \prod_{\Lambda} \Hom_{k}(k, k) \cong \prod_{\Lambda} k
	\]
	we get the desired result by Tychonov's theorem in \cref{prop:linear_compactness_properties}. 
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:dual-of-discrete-is-complete}
	Note that in the proof of the previous lemma the dual space of a discrete space is complete, as it is an arbitrary product of $k$ endowed with the product topology.
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:dual-space-is-tate}
	If $V$ is a Tate space then $V^{*}$ with the topology previously introduced is also a Tate space.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	If we decompose $V = L \oplus D$ where $L$ is a c-lattice and $D$ a d-lattice then $V^{*} \cong L^{*} \oplus D^{*}$ and by \cref{lemm:duality-d-lattice-c-lattice} $L^{*}$ is discrete and $D^{*}$ is linearly compact. Observe that $D^{*}$ is open in $V^{*}$ since it is the kernel of the projection $V^{*} \to V^{*}/L^{\perp}$ and $V^{*}/L^{\perp}$ is discrete by the description of our topology in the dual $V^{*}$. Since $L^{*}$ is discrete, then it is complete. Moreover, by the previous remark, $D^{*}$ is complete, hence $V^{*}$ is complete too.
\end{proof}

We're ready to prove the analog of Pontryagin's duality for locally compact groups in our context.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:self-duality}
	For a Tate space $V$ the canonical map $V \to V^{**}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	It is enough to prove it for complete linearly compact spaces and discrete spaces, as every Tate space can be decomposed into a direct sum of a c-lattice and a d-lattice. First, we do it for discrete spaces. Suppose $D$ is a discrete vector space. Then, the canonical map
	\[
		\operatorname{ev}\colon D \to D^{**}
	\]
	is open and continuous because $D$ and $D^{**}$ are both discrete by \cref{lemm:duality-d-lattice-c-lattice}. Moreover, it is injective, because for every nonzero $v \in D$ there exists a linear continuous functional $\phi\in D^{*}$ such that $\phi(v)\neq 0$. Finally, we prove surjectivity. Let $\psi \in D^{**}$. Since $\ker \psi$ is open it contains a basic open vector subspace $A^{\perp}$ such that $A \subseteq D$ is a linearly compact subspace. Therefore, since $D^{*}$ is linearly compact it follows that $D^{*} \sim A^{\perp}$, that is, the quotient $D^{*}/A^{\perp}$ is finite dimensional. Recall that the inclusion $\iota\colon A \to D$ induces an isomorphism $D^{*}/A^{\perp} \to A^{*}$ which is a homeomorphism since both spaces are discrete. We can factor $\psi$ so that the following diagram commutes
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		D^{*} \arrow[r, "\psi"] \arrow[d] & k \\
		D^{*}/A^{\perp} \arrow[ru, dashed, "\tilde{\psi}"] \arrow[d, swap, "\cong"] & \\
		A^{*} \arrow[ruu, dashed, swap, bend right, "\overline{\psi}"]
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	However, $A^{*}$ is finite dimensional, therefore, there exists some $a \in A$ such that $\overline{\psi} = \operatorname{ev}_{a}$ as maps from $A^{*}\to k$. Moreover, since $A^{\perp} \subseteq \ker\psi$ we conclude that $\psi = \operatorname{ev}_{a}$ as maps $D^{*} \to k$. This implies surjectivity. Thus $D \to D^{**}$ is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces. \\

	Now, suppose $L$ is a complete linearly compact space. We check first that the map 
	\[
		\operatorname{ev}\colon L \to L^{**}
	\]
	is continuous. Let $A^{\perp}$ be an open vector subspace in $L^{**}$ where $A \subseteq L^{*}$ is a linearly compact subspace. By \cref{lemm:duality-d-lattice-c-lattice} $L^{*}$ is discrete, hence $A$ is finite dimensional. Suppose that $A = \operatorname{span}(\phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{n})$ for some $\phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{n} \in A$. Then, $\operatorname{ev}^{-1}(A^{\perp}) = \ker \phi_{1} \cap \ldots \cap \ker \phi_{n}$ which is open in $L$. Now, we check that $\operatorname{ev}$ is injective. Let $v \in L$ be a nonzero vector. Choose a decomposition of $L = U \oplus F$ where $U$ is open and $F$ is finite dimensional containing $v$ (this can be done because $L$ is separated and linearly compact). Let $\phi$ be a linear functional such that restricted to $U$ is zero and $\phi(v) \neq 0$. Since $U$ is open and $F$ discrete such $\phi$ exists and it is continuous. This implies injectivity of $\operatorname{ev}$.  Now we check that $\operatorname{ev}$ is surjective. Since $L$ is complete 
	\[
		L \cong \varprojlim_{U \in \mathscr{U}} L/U
	\]
	where $\mathscr{U}$ runs over open vector subspaces of $U$. Let $\psi\colon L^{*} \to k$ be a continuous linear functional. By pulling back $\pi_{U}\colon L \to L/U$ we get an injection $\pi_{U}^{*}\colon(L/U)^{*} \hookrightarrow L^{*}$ for every $U \in \mathscr{U}$. Since $L$ is linearly compact, then $L/U$ is finite dimensional, thus, there exists some $v_{U}\in L$ such that $\psi \circ \pi_{U}^{*} = \operatorname{ev}_{v_{U}}$ where $\operatorname{ev}\colon L/U \to (L/U)^{**}$. In particular, observe that if $U,U' \in \mathscr{U}$ and $U' \subseteq U$ we get an induced injection $(L/U)^{*} \hookrightarrow (L/U')^{*}$ such that the following diagram
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		L^{*} \arrow[rr, "\psi"] & & k \\
		(L/U')^{*} \arrow[u, hook] \arrow[urr, swap, "\operatorname{ev}_{v_{U'}}"] & & \\
		(L/U)^{*} \arrow[u, hook] \arrow[uurr, swap, bend right, "\operatorname{ev}_{v_{U}}"] \arrow[uu, bend left = 70, hook]& & 
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	commutes. Observe that this implies that $(v_{U})_{U\in \mathscr{U}}$ is a Cauchy net and by completeness of $V$ it follows that it is convergent. Therefore, there exists some $v \in L$ limit of $(v_{U})_{U\in \mathscr{U}}$. We claim that $\psi = \operatorname{ev}_{v}$. Let $\phi \in L^{*}$. Then, $\ker\phi$ is open and since $L$ is linearly compact then $\ker\phi \sim L$. Hence, if we factor $\phi$ as follows
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		L \arrow[r, "\phi"] \arrow[d, swap, "\pi_{\ker\phi}"] & k \\
		L/\ker\phi \arrow[ur, swap, "\overline{\phi}"] &
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	 since $L/\ker\phi$ is discrete we conclude that $\overline{\phi}$ is continuous. In other words, the image of $\overline{\phi}$ under the inclusion $(L/\ker\phi)^{*} \hookrightarrow L^{*}$ is $\phi$. Thus, $\psi(\phi) = \operatorname{ev}_{v_{\ker\phi}}(\overline{\phi})$ and by convergence $\psi(\phi) = \operatorname{ev}_{v}(\phi)$. This implies surjectivity of $\operatorname{ev}\colon L \to L^{**}$. To conclude, we prove that $\operatorname{ev}$ is open. Let $U$ be any open vector subspace in $L$, thus $L = U \oplus F$ for some $F$ finite dimensional. We claim that $\operatorname{ev}(U) = (F^{*})^{\perp}$. First, the inclusion $\operatorname{ev}(U) \subseteq (F^{*})^{\perp}$ is immediate. Let $\psi \in (F^{*})^{\perp}$. Let $v \in L$ such that $\operatorname{ev}_{v} = \psi$. Write $v = u + f$ where $u \in U$ and $f \in F$. Hence, $\operatorname{ev}_{v} = \operatorname{ev}_{u} + \operatorname{ev}_{f}$. Since $\operatorname{ev}$ is injective, it follows that there exists some $\phi\in F^{*}$ such that $\phi(f) \neq 0$ if $f$ is nonzero. Therefore, $f = 0$ and $\psi \in \operatorname{ev}(U)$. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:completeness-is-necessary-for-sel-duality}
	Observe that completeness cannot be dropped in the definition of a Tate space while preserving duality. Indeed, if $V$ is linearly compact but not complete its dual is discrete by \cref{lemm:duality-d-lattice-c-lattice} and by \cref{rem:dual-of-discrete-is-complete} its double dual is complete, hence $V \to V^{**}$ cannot be an isomorphism.
\end{remark}
\subsection*{Morphisms}
A \textbf{morphism} of Tate spaces is a continuous linear homomorphism between Tate spaces.
\begin{definition}\label{def:linearly-compact-and-discrete-morphisms}
	A morphism $f\colon V\to W$ of Tate spaces is said to be \textbf{linearly compact} if the closure of $f(V)$ is linearly compact in $W$. Dually, it is \textbf{discrete} if $\ker f$ is open in $V$. 
\end{definition}
First, we check the duality natural property for morphisms of Tate spaces.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:duality-discrete-compact-maps}
	A morphism $f\colon V\to W$ of Tate spaces is linearly compact if and only if $f^{*}$ is discrete.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $f^{*}$ is linearly compact, then $\ker f^{*} = f(V)^{\perp}$. However, if $\phi\in W^{*}$ and $\phi(f(V)) = 0$ then $\phi(\overline{f(V)}) = 0$ by continuity of $\phi$. Therefore, $\ker f^{*} = \overline{f(V)}^{\perp}$ which is open because $\overline{f(V)}$ is linearly compact. Now, suppose $f^{*}$ is discrete. Thus, $\ker f^{*}$ contains a basic open subspace $A^{\perp}$ such that $A$ is linearly compact in $W$. Therefore, $f(V)\subseteq A$ then $\overline{f(V)} \subseteq A$ and by item (c) in \cref{prop:linear_compactness_properties} $\overline{f(V)}$ is linearly compact.
\end{proof}
Discrete and linearly compact operators form a 2-sided ideal in $\Hom$; that is
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:compact-and-discrete-2-sided-ideal}
	If $f$ is a linearly compact operator (respectively discrete) then its composition (from any side) with an arbitrary morphism of Tate spaces is also linearly compact (respectively discrete). 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \xrightarrow{h} D$ be morphisms of Tate spaces such that $g$ is linearly compact. Then, $\overline{g\circ f(A)} \subseteq \overline{g(B)}$ which is linearly compact, thus $\overline{g\circ f(A)}$ is linearly compact too. On the other hand, note that $h(\overline{g(B)}) \subseteq \overline{h\circ g(B)}$; therefore $\overline{h(\overline{g(B)})} = \overline{h\circ g(B)}$. However, $\overline{g(B)}$ is linearly compact and by item(b) in \cref{prop:linear_compactness_properties} $\overline{h(\overline{g(B)})}$ is linearly compact. In addition, the statement for discrete operators follows from the previous proposition.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}\label{def:2-sided-ideals-in-hom}
	Let $V$ and $W$ be Tate spaces. \linebreak We denote $\Hom_{+}(V,W)$ to be the set of linearly compact morphisms and $\Hom_{-}(V,W)$ the set of discrete ones. Also, set $\Hom_{0}(V,W)$ to be $\Hom_{+}(V,W) \cap \Hom_{-}(V,W)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:discrete-compact-operators-present-the-whole-space}
	The sets $\Hom_{-}(V,W), \Hom_{+}(V,W)$ and \linebreak $\Hom_{0}(V,W)$ are vector subspaces of $\Hom(V,W)$. Moreover,
	\[
		\Hom_{-}(V,W) + \Hom_{+}(V,W) = \Hom(V,W).
	\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $L$ be a c-lattice in $V$ and consider $\pi\colon V \to L$ be a continuous linear projection. Then $\pi$ realized as an element of $\End(V)$ satisfies $\pi \in\End_{+}(V)$ and $1 -\pi\in\End_{-}(V)$. Hence, by \cref{prop:compact-and-discrete-2-sided-ideal} for every $f\in \Hom(V,W)$ $f\circ \pi$ and $f\circ (1 - \pi)$ are linearly compact and discrete respectively. It follows
	\[
		\Hom_{-}(V,W) + \Hom_{+}(V,W) = \Hom(V,W).
	\]
	The other statements are immediate.
\end{proof}
