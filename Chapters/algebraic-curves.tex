\chapter{Algebraic curves}\label{ch:algebraic-curves}
In the preceding chapter we presented the ``residue map'' in an abstract context. In this chapter we explore residues on algebraic curves using Tate's construction. First, we recall briefly the basic theory of algebraic projective curves. We reference the reader to \cite{curves}. 
\section{Basic theory of algebraic curves}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.
\begin{definition}\label{def:algebraic-curve}
	An \textbf{algebraic curve} is a one-dimensional non-singular projective variety.
\end{definition}
